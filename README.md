# ArgFormatter
This is a header-only library whose purpose is to serve as a limited replacement for &lt;format>/libfmt. This is more for use in my own projects more than anything else - the goal was simply to try to make something faster than &lt;format> on Windows specifically, which this achieves. This hasn't been benched against libfmt itself though. This is actually what is used in Serenity_Logger for the built in formatting.
